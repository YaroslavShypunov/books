# Books Project

This is a React.js project named `Books`, aimed at providing a comprehensive platform for book enthusiasts. It leverages modern front-end technologies including React for building the user interface, Redux for state management, Material UI for UI components, and Formik for form management, among other tools.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This project requires Node.js version 16.x or later.

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd books
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

- **To start the development server:**

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

  This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- **To build the app for production:**

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Testing

- **To run tests:**

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Features

- **React 18 & React DOM**: For building the UI components and managing the DOM.

- **Material UI**: Provides a wide range of styled components that follow Material Design principles.
- **React Router DOM**: For declarative routing within the application.
- **Formik & Yup**: Simplify form handling and validation.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static type definitions to enhance code quality and understandability.
- **Emotion**: A powerful library for writing css styles with JavaScript.
- **Testing Library**: Tools for testing the app components in a user-centric way.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite.
- `npm run eject`: **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!
